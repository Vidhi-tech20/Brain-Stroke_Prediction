# Brain_Stroke_Prediction

Introduction

Brain stroke is a critical health condition that requires early detection to prevent severe complications. This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on patient data such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle factors. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and improve patient care through predictive analytics.

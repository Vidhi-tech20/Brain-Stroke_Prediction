🧠 Brain Stroke Predictor
📌 Overview

Brain Stroke Predictor is a machine learning–based project designed to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke using key patient features such as age, glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and lifestyle habits.
The aim is to support early diagnosis, reduce risk, and assist healthcare professionals with quick decision-making.

✨ Features

✔️ User-friendly prediction interface

✔️ Clean & preprocessed medical dataset

✔️ Multiple ML models tested & compared

✔️ Model explainability (correlation heatmaps, feature importance)

✔️ Exportable trained model (.pkl)

✔️ Web-based interface (Streamlit/Flask — if included)

🧰 Tech Stack
